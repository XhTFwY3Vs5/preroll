# RPG Dice Roll Pre-generator

This simple HTML file pre-generates a large number of dice rolls for various common RPG dice types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100). It's designed to be printed or viewed offline, providing a readily available pool of random numbers for your tabletop role-playing games.

## How it Works

The script uses JavaScript to:

*   Generate a specified number of random rolls for each dice type.
*   Display these rolls in organized tables.
*   The number of rows and columns in the tables can be adjusted within the script.

## Usage

1.  **Save the file:** Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `rpg_dice.html`).
2.  **Open in browser:** Open the saved HTML file in your web browser.
3.  **Print (Optional):** You can print the page directly from your browser to have a physical copy of the dice rolls. The styling includes a `page-break-before: always` for the d12 section to help with printing layout.
4.  **View offline:** The rolls are generated client-side, so you can view them even without an internet connection.

## Customization

You can easily customize the number of rolls generated by modifying the `rows` and `columns` variables within the `<script>` tag.

*   **`rows`**: Controls the number of rows in each table.
*   **`columns`**: Controls the number of columns in each table.

For example, to generate 10 rows and 20 columns for each dice type, you would change:

```javascript
var rows = 8;
var columns = 25;
// ... (and later)
rows = 12;
```

to something like:

```javascript
var rows = 10;
var columns = 20;
// ... (and later)
rows = 10; // Keep the same number of rows for d20 and d100 if desired

## Disclaimer

While this tool provides a convenient way to pre-generate dice rolls, remember that true randomness is a complex topic. For critical game mechanics where strict statistical distribution is paramount, consider using dedicated dice rolling applications or physical dice. This tool is intended for convenience and quick access to a large pool of numbers.
